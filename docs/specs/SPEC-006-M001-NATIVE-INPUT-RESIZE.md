# SPEC-006 — M001 native input, focus/IME seam and authoritative resize

- **Status:** Proposed for M001 Pass 7
- **Date:** 2026-08-27
- **Issue:** #702
- **Architecture authority:** Foundation Architecture + ADR-001 + ADR-004 + ADR-005 + ADR-006
- **Depends on:** SPEC-001, SPEC-002, SPEC-003, SPEC-004, SPEC-005

## 1. Purpose

This specification defines the observable M001 Pass 7 contract that makes the permanent macOS Metal terminal surface interactive without moving terminal authority into the GUI.

The required input path is:

```text
NSEvent / AppKit text-input callbacks
→ native normalization
→ bounded typed client queue
→ compact local protocol
→ Runtime authorization
→ Runtime-owned terminal-key encoding
→ bounded Runtime input admission
→ PTY
→ shell/application
```

The required resize path is:

```text
usable native terminal viewport
→ desired rows/columns proposal
→ bounded client control queue
→ correlated ResizeRequest
→ Runtime authorization + validation/prepare
→ fallible PTY winsize
→ canonical TerminalState resize commit
→ asynchronous ResizeResult bookkeeping
→ damage/projection
→ permanent Metal renderer
```

`ResizeResult` is never an acknowledgement dependency for terminal progress. Runtime commits or rejects the resize transaction independently and queues the result asynchronously.

Pass 7 does not create a GUI VT parser, mirrored mode state, client-owned grid, second PTY, temporary text renderer or synchronous GUI acknowledgement dependency.

## 2. Non-negotiable invariants

1. `TerminalExecution` remains sole owner of the PTY, child lifecycle and canonical `TerminalState`.
2. Runtime remains the authority for attachment role, terminal-mode-sensitive key encoding, input admission, PTY writes and canonical resize commit.
3. AppKit owns only native event normalization plus ephemeral focus/IME composition state.
4. The client never consults disposable display state to decide terminal escape sequences.
5. Existing `Input` bytes represent already-committed literal input bytes. They are not a license for Swift to synthesize mode-sensitive terminal key sequences.
6. Semantic terminal keys cross the client/Runtime boundary as typed logical keys, not pre-encoded escape bytes.
7. One accepted native input action is admitted atomically. It is never partially accepted, silently truncated, silently dropped or split differently depending on backpressure.
8. Accepted input preserves FIFO ordering. New input is explicitly rejected on bounded backpressure rather than blocking AppKit/main-thread progress or allocating unbounded memory.
9. Pass 7 native resize uses explicit request identity. A failure/result may mutate bookkeeping for only the exact request ID it names; an older result cannot invalidate a newer request.
10. A Runtime resize failure never causes an immediate resend loop. Runtime-reported failures are retry-gated by an external recovery event defined in section 12.6.
11. Resize never publishes canonical geometry before the PTY accepts the winsize transaction.
12. `NSTextInputClient` exposes only a bounded ephemeral composition document. Terminal/history text is never returned through text-input APIs and never becomes a second editable text model.
13. No input/resize path waits synchronously for rendering, display projection, Block semantics, persistence, agents, cloud, telemetry or licensing.
14. Input, marked text and terminal contents are secret-bearing data and are never emitted by latency instrumentation or normal diagnostic logs.

## 3. Scope

Pass 7 includes:

- first-responder/focus behavior for the permanent `MetalSurfaceView` terminal surface;
- AppKit native event normalization;
- committed UTF-8 text input;
- the exact M001 semantic terminal-key subset in section 6;
- Runtime-owned key encoding seam;
- Controller attachment for an interactive client;
- bounded, nonblocking client input/control queuing;
- native viewport → rows/columns calculation and authoritative resize submission;
- explicit correlated `ResizeRequest` / `ResizeResult` protocol extension;
- desired/unresolved/committed resize reconciliation;
- error-class retry gating;
- resize coalescing with ordering barriers;
- permanent AppKit `NSTextInputClient` composition seam with explicit UTF-16 range semantics;
- minimum accessibility/focus seam on the Metal surface;
- input/resize latency instrumentation and benchmarks;
- deterministic, integration, failure and fuzz coverage required by section 16.

Pass 7 does not claim full terminal application compatibility. The canonical M001 workload remains a normal interactive shell plus the accepted minimal alternate-screen fixture.

## 4. Native input classification

Every native key/text event is classified into exactly one of these categories before terminal submission:

```text
ApplicationCommand
CommittedText
SemanticTerminalKey
CompositionState
Unsupported
```

### 4.1 ApplicationCommand

An application/menu shortcut is handled by the native application layer and is never simultaneously submitted to the PTY.

M001 reserves the Command modifier for application/menu handling. `Command`-modified events must not become `Input` or `TerminalKey` frames merely because AppKit also exposes characters for the event.

Pass 7 does not define a configurable keybinding system.

### 4.2 CommittedText

Text committed by the AppKit text-input system is encoded as UTF-8 and submitted using the existing SPEC-004 `Input` message.

Committed text may originate from ordinary printable input, keyboard-layout transformations, dead-key composition or an input method after composition commits.

The client does not reinterpret committed Unicode text into terminal key sequences.

### 4.3 SemanticTerminalKey

Terminal-control keys that are not ordinary committed text use the additive `TerminalKey` protocol extension in section 7. Runtime maps the logical key to bytes using canonical terminal semantics.

### 4.4 CompositionState

Marked/preedit text is client-local ephemeral state. It is not terminal history, is not an `Input` message and never reaches Runtime/PTY until the AppKit text-input contract commits it through `insertText` or `unmarkText` as defined in section 13.

### 4.5 Unsupported

An unsupported native event is not guessed into terminal bytes. It remains unhandled or follows ordinary native application behavior. Debug diagnostics may record only the event category/key identifier, never text content.

## 5. Event-routing order

The terminal surface must avoid duplicate delivery through `keyDown`, menu key equivalents and AppKit text interpretation, while preserving IME control of composition keys.

The behavioral order is:

1. allow recognized application/menu commands to resolve as native application commands;
2. if marked/composition state is active, give the active AppKit text-input context first opportunity to consume the event; if consumed, stop terminal routing for that event;
3. when no active composition consumed the event, recognize the supported non-text terminal keys and supported Control-key combinations from the native event;
4. route remaining text-producing input through AppKit's text-input/IME machinery;
5. submit only text that the `NSTextInputClient` contract commits as `Input`;
6. preserve marked/preedit callbacks locally;
7. never submit one physical/native event by more than one route.

This ordering is required so Enter/Escape/arrows can commit, cancel or navigate an active IME candidate session instead of leaking to the PTY, while ordinary terminal navigation keys are not unconditionally consumed as AppKit editing selectors when no composition owns them.

A production implementation may use `NSTextInputContext`, `interpretKeyEvents` or equivalent AppKit mechanisms, but it must satisfy this observable classification/order. It must not unconditionally text-interpret navigation/function keys if that causes terminal keys to leak, disappear or be delivered twice.

## 6. Exact M001 keyboard matrix

Pass 7 intentionally implements a small permanent semantic-key layer that can be extended in M002 without changing AppKit ownership.

### 6.1 Supported M001

| Native intent | Wire representation | Runtime M001 result |
|---|---|---|
| committed printable/Unicode text | `Input` UTF-8 bytes | bytes unchanged |
| Return/Enter | `TerminalKey::Enter` | `CR` (`0x0D`) |
| Tab | `TerminalKey::Tab` | `HT` (`0x09`) |
| Backspace | `TerminalKey::Backspace` | `DEL` (`0x7F`) |
| Escape | `TerminalKey::Escape` | `ESC` (`0x1B`) |
| Up | `TerminalKey::ArrowUp` | normal-mode ANSI `ESC [ A` |
| Down | `TerminalKey::ArrowDown` | normal-mode ANSI `ESC [ B` |
| Right | `TerminalKey::ArrowRight` | normal-mode ANSI `ESC [ C` |
| Left | `TerminalKey::ArrowLeft` | normal-mode ANSI `ESC [ D` |
| Control + supported ASCII base | `TerminalKey::ControlAscii` + normalized scalar | section 6.2 mapping |
| native key repeat for any supported semantic key | repeated semantic-key submissions | same ordering/encoding per occurrence |

The arrow-key encoding lives in Runtime even though M001 does not yet implement/advertise application-cursor mode. M002 may add DECCKM/application-keypad semantics to the Runtime encoder without changing the native event boundary. Pass 7 must not invent fake canonical mode state merely to demonstrate a mode toggle.

The current `seyal-m001` terminfo deliberately does not advertise cursor-key capabilities. Pass 7 tests that arrow intent crosses the Runtime encoder and reaches the PTY correctly; it does not use these arrows to claim ncurses/TUI key-discovery compatibility before the owning M002 capability work.

### 6.2 Control ASCII native normalization and Runtime mapping

`ControlAscii` is intentionally layout-aware but terminal-mode-independent. Swift/AppKit determines only the logical ASCII base scalar; Runtime still owns conversion of that scalar to the terminal control byte.

For a native event to become `ControlAscii` in M001:

1. active IME/composition handling from section 5 must not already have consumed the event;
2. the device-independent modifier set must contain `Control`;
3. `Shift` and `CapsLock` may additionally be present because they can affect the AppKit-produced character/case;
4. `Command`, `Option`, `Function`, `NumericPad` or any other semantic modifier makes the combination unsupported for `ControlAscii` in M001;
5. use that event's AppKit `charactersIgnoringModifiers` result as the layout-derived candidate, requiring exactly one Unicode scalar;
6. AppKit preserving the Shift effect in `charactersIgnoringModifiers` is deliberate here: for example a layout on which Shift+2 produces `@` may normalize Control+Shift+2 to the ASCII base `@`;
7. do not reconstruct a US keyboard from physical `keyCode`, do not remove Shift by hand and do not perform locale-dependent case conversion;
8. require the candidate to be ASCII and one of the bases below; ASCII `a..z` is normalized to `A..Z`, while ASCII uppercase is unchanged;
9. the wire `TerminalKey::ControlAscii.modifiers` contains only protocol `CONTROL`; native Shift/CapsLock are normalization inputs and are not terminal modifier state in M001.

The accepted Runtime mapping is exactly:

```text
@ / Space → NUL 0x00
A..Z      → 0x01..0x1A
[          → ESC 0x1B
\          → FS  0x1C
]          → GS  0x1D
^          → RS  0x1E
_          → US  0x1F
?          → DEL 0x7F
```

Examples are therefore defined by the active keyboard layout, not by US physical key positions. If a different layout produces a different scalar for the same hardware key, classification follows that produced scalar. A combination that does not yield one supported ASCII base is `Unsupported` and must not fall through into a different terminal-control interpretation.

This native normalization is testable as a pure boundary using `(modifier flags, charactersIgnoringModifiers)` fixtures, plus AppKit integration tests. Tests must include lowercase/uppercase letters, Shift-produced `@`, `^`, `_`, `?`, Space, the bracket/backslash family, CapsLock, and at least one synthetic non-US-layout case proving there is no hard-coded US key-position table.

### 6.3 Explicitly deferred keyboard behavior

M001 does not claim:

- Option/Alt-as-Meta terminal policy;
- configurable Option-as-Alt behavior;
- application-cursor or application-keypad mode switching;
- Home/End/Insert/DeleteForward/PageUp/PageDown terminal sequences;
- Shift-Tab/backtab terminal sequence;
- function keys F1+;
- modified cursor/function-key xterm protocols;
- kitty keyboard protocol;
- arbitrary user keybindings/macros.

Unsupported combinations must not be silently rewritten into a different supported key.

## 7. SPEC-004 additive Pass 7 protocol extension

Pass 7 adds semantic-key and correlated-resize messages without changing framing version `1.0`.

### 7.1 Capabilities

Server capability bits added by Pass 7 are:

```text
CAP_SEMANTIC_TERMINAL_KEY = 1 << 2
CAP_CORRELATED_RESIZE     = 1 << 3
```

A Pass 7 interactive native client requires both capabilities before enabling its full input/resize success path. An older Runtime remains valid for Pass 5/6 display but is not Pass 7 interactive-capable.

Existing Pass 5/6 clients tolerate unknown `ServerHello.server_capabilities` bits and require only `CAP_BINARY_DISPLAY`; advertising bits 2 and 3 therefore remains backward compatible with the current 1.0 display client. Regression tests must preserve this behavior.

The client must not probe support by sending unknown messages first.

### 7.2 Message types

```text
17  C→R  TerminalKey
18  C→R  ResizeRequest
19  R→C  ResizeResult
```

Legacy type-10 `Resize` remains defined by SPEC-004 for existing protocol compatibility. The Pass 7 native surface must use `ResizeRequest` after `CAP_CORRELATED_RESIZE` negotiation and must not use uncorrelated type 10 for its production resize path.

### 7.3 `TerminalKey` payload

`TerminalKey` is exactly 24 bytes:

```text
u128 AttachmentId
u16  key_kind
u16  modifiers
u32  scalar
```

M001 `key_kind` values:

```text
1 Enter
2 Tab
3 Backspace
4 Escape
5 ArrowUp
6 ArrowDown
7 ArrowRight
8 ArrowLeft
9 ControlAscii
```

M001 `modifiers` is zero for kinds 1–8. `ControlAscii` requires exactly bit 0 (`CONTROL`) and no other bits. All unknown modifier bits are malformed. `scalar` must be zero for kinds 1–8 and must be one supported ASCII base scalar from section 6.2 for `ControlAscii`.

Malformed `TerminalKey` frames return `MalformedPayload` without terminal mutation. Unknown kind values are malformed in protocol 1.0.

### 7.4 `ResizeRequest` payload and identity

`ResizeRequest` is exactly 32 bytes:

```text
u128 AttachmentId
u64  request_id
u16  rows
u16  columns
u32  reserved = 0
```

Rules:

- `request_id` is client-generated, connection-local and nonzero;
- IDs increase monotonically for that connection; wrap/reuse is forbidden;
- reconnect starts a fresh request-ID space because the connection and `AttachmentId` change;
- a not-yet-started coalesced request may keep its existing ID while its unsent target is replaced; once any byte of the frame is written, both ID and geometry are immutable;
- Runtime validates `AttachmentId`, Controller authority, request ID, reserved bits and geometry before terminal mutation;
- an ID repeated on the same live connection is malformed and fails closed;
- request IDs are protocol bookkeeping only, never terminal generations, persistent identities, telemetry IDs or benchmark trace IDs.

### 7.5 `ResizeResult` payload

`ResizeResult` is exactly 32 bytes:

```text
u128 AttachmentId
u64  request_id
u16  result_code
u16  reserved0 = 0
u32  detail_code
```

`result_code` is:

```text
0  Applied
1..14  same numeric meanings as SPEC-004 Error codes
```

For every structurally valid `ResizeRequest` from which Runtime can trust `AttachmentId` and nonzero `request_id`, Runtime queues exactly one `ResizeResult` after the request transaction reaches a final outcome.

- `Applied` is queued only after PTY winsize succeeds and canonical `TerminalState` resize commit completes.
- Failure result codes are queued after validation/application failure with canonical geometry unchanged when the transaction did not commit.
- `detail_code` is zero in M001 unless a later accepted specification assigns a bounded non-secret machine-readable reason.
- `ResizeResult` is mandatory bounded control output. It is never presentation-superseded.
- Runtime, PTY, VT and renderer progress never wait for the client to read a result.

If framing/payload corruption prevents trustworthy request-ID extraction, Runtime uses the existing `Error`/fatal protocol path; the Pass 7 client treats an uncorrelatable type-18 failure as protocol failure and never guesses which request failed.

### 7.6 Why `Input` remains

`Input` remains the efficient bulk path for already-committed bytes such as UTF-8 committed text. `TerminalKey` exists only where the client must preserve semantic intent so Runtime can own terminal encoding.

Pass 7 does not wrap every printable character into one message per scalar.

## 8. Runtime key encoding authority

Runtime decodes `TerminalKey` into a typed internal key intent and admits the resulting bytes through the same bounded input accounting used by SPEC-003.

The encoder consumes canonical terminal mode state when a supported key's encoding depends on a mode. M001 currently has no accepted application-cursor/keypad input mode, so arrows use the normal-mode sequences in section 6; future supported modes extend this encoder rather than adding GUI state.

The encode/admit operation must be all-or-nothing for one logical key: capacity is checked for the complete encoded byte sequence before any byte from that key is accepted. Backpressure never leaves a partial escape sequence accepted.

Only the Runtime reactor owner writes resulting bytes to the PTY, preserving SPEC-003 ordering and reservation accounting.

## 9. Interactive attachment and authority

The production Pass 7 terminal surface requests `Controller`, not `Observer`, for the execution it intends to control.

Rules:

- no client silently preempts an existing controller;
- `ControllerBusy` is an explicit noninteractive state;
- the Pass 7 surface must not appear to accept terminal typing while only Observer authority exists;
- no silent fallback may accept native input locally and discard it;
- reconnect obtains a new attachment/controller lease under normal SPEC-004 semantics; old `AttachmentId` and Resize request IDs are stale;
- losing the connection or controller authority cancels marked composition locally and stops accepting terminal mutation until authority is re-established.

A future product may offer an intentional read-only observer UI; that is not the success path claimed by Pass 7.

## 10. Bounded client outbound queue and exact input admission

The display client evolves into a local terminal client with one ordered outbound control/input queue.

M001 client-side accepted-but-not-fully-written wire bytes are bounded to **262,144 bytes per connection**, including frame headers. This is separate from Runtime's SPEC-003 accepted-but-unwritten PTY budgets.

Requirements:

- FIFO for `Input`, `TerminalKey`, non-coalesced `ResizeRequest` and mandatory control messages;
- no per-key or per-resize thread/task/process;
- no busy retry on `WouldBlock`;
- writable readiness is armed only while bytes remain;
- a partially written frame is immutable and completed before another frame begins;
- admission that would exceed the client budget returns explicit local backpressure before ownership is accepted;
- already accepted frames are never silently dropped to make room for newer input;
- secret-bearing payloads are never logged when backpressure occurs;
- the queue may store encoded frames or typed entries, but it must not serialize through JSON or another general-purpose object format.

### 10.1 Committed-text atomicity

One non-empty AppKit committed-text callback is one logical M001 input action.

The exact behavior is:

1. convert the complete committed string to UTF-8 without lossy substitution;
2. if the result is empty, treat it as a no-op;
3. if the UTF-8 byte length exceeds SPEC-004's 65,536-byte `Input` limit, reject the **entire** commit locally as `CommitTooLarge`; M001 does not chunk it;
4. otherwise construct exactly one `Input` frame for that callback;
5. atomically admit the complete frame, including framing overhead, only if it fits the remaining 262,144-byte client queue budget;
6. if it does not fit, reject the **entire** commit locally as `ClientBackpressure` before any byte from that commit becomes owned by the queue;
7. never submit a prefix and never split a Unicode scalar or one AppKit committed callback across multiple `Input` frames in M001.

`TerminalKey` admission is likewise atomic for its complete frame. A rejected semantic key is not partially encoded or queued.

### 10.2 Visible non-silent rejection state

Because an AppKit commit has already occurred by the time the client attempts queue admission, local rejection must never be silent.

The native terminal surface owns a small non-canonical `InputAdmissionFailure` presentation state with at least these reason categories:

```text
ClientBackpressure
CommitTooLarge
LostController
Disconnected
UnsupportedReplacementRange
CompositionTooLarge
```

On rejection:

- no rejected text/key payload is retained for automatic retry;
- no rejected payload is logged, copied into accessibility text or persisted;
- the terminal surface visibly reports a non-secret reason;
- the state is exposed accessibly without exposing the rejected content;
- AppKit/main-thread execution returns immediately;
- automatic replay is forbidden because rejection occurs before ownership and an implicit retry could duplicate later user intent.

For transient client-queue backpressure, the visible busy state may clear after writable progress restores local admission capacity or after a subsequent input admission succeeds. Authority/disconnection failures clear only when the corresponding connection/controller state changes. Tests assert the reason state and visibility contract, not pixel styling.

## 11. Resize geometry derivation

### 11.1 Native proposal only

AppKit computes a rows/columns **desired proposal** from the usable terminal viewport in logical points and the permanent renderer's cell metrics/insets.

Before subtraction, division, `floor` or integer conversion, validate every operand:

```text
viewportWidth, viewportHeight,
horizontalInsets, verticalInsets,
cellWidth, cellHeight
```

All six values must be finite. Viewport dimensions and insets must be non-negative. Cell width/height must be strictly greater than zero.

Then compute:

```text
usableWidth  = viewportWidth  - horizontalInsets
usableHeight = viewportHeight - verticalInsets
```

Both derived usable dimensions must also be finite and strictly positive. The division ratios must be finite and strictly positive before `floor` or conversion.

Only after those checks:

```text
columns = clamp(floor(usableWidth  / cellWidth),  1, 512)
rows    = clamp(floor(usableHeight / cellHeight), 1, 256)
```

Clamping occurs while still in floating/numeric-safe form before conversion to the bounded integer wire type.

If any source operand is NaN or ±Infinity, any required sign constraint fails, any derived subtraction/division is non-finite, or either usable dimension is non-positive, there is no valid desired geometry for that layout sample and no new request is admitted.

A tiny but positive valid viewport converges to at least `1×1`; an extremely large but finite viewport is capped at `512×256`.

The implementation must use one authoritative renderer/layout cell-metric source rather than independently re-measuring fonts in resize code.

### 11.2 Backing scale

A backing-scale change may invalidate renderer resources under SPEC-005, but it must not change Runtime rows/columns unless the usable logical geometry/cell layout yields different rows/columns.

GPU pixel dimensions are not terminal geometry authority.

### 11.3 Layout chrome

Pass 7 has one terminal surface. Future composer/Block chrome may change the usable terminal viewport only through the same rows/columns proposal path; it may not resize a hidden GUI grid independently.

## 12. Resize ordering, reconciliation, correlation and retry policy

Correctness requires final-layout convergence, exact request-result correlation and no automatic retry loop under persistent failure.

### 12.1 Client state

The client tracks bounded state:

```text
desiredGeometry       latest valid geometry derived from current native layout
committedGeometry     latest geometry observed from authoritative display projection
nextResizeRequestId   next nonzero monotonically increasing u64 ID
unresolvedResizes     bounded ordered records keyed by request_id
retrySuppression      optional failed target + failure class + recovery epoch
```

Each unresolved record contains at least:

```text
request_id
geometry
phase = queued_not_started | writing | sent_waiting_result
```

The queue byte bound limits queued request records; the protocol requires exactly one `ResizeResult` for every sent structurally valid request, so sent records do not accumulate indefinitely.

`desiredGeometry` is presentation intent, not terminal authority. `committedGeometry` is observational knowledge of canonical state, not a second canonical grid. Request IDs and records are transport bookkeeping only.

The **effective outstanding geometry** is the target of the newest unresolved request, if any.

### 12.2 Request admission and coalescing

Given valid desired target `D` and no retry suppression blocking `D`:

- if the newest unresolved request already targets `D`, no new request is needed;
- if no unresolved request exists and `D == committedGeometry`, no request is needed;
- otherwise enqueue a new `ResizeRequest(D)` or coalesce only the newest `queued_not_started` ResizeRequest when there is no intervening `Input`, `TerminalKey` or other ordering barrier;
- a request ID is nonzero and unique for the connection. A coalesced not-yet-started request may keep its ID while its target changes;
- once any byte begins writing, request ID and target are immutable;
- local queue admission failure retains desired geometry and may retry when **local** queue capacity progresses because no Runtime request was sent.

The client must not move resize across accepted input/key frames, reorder input around resize, mutate a partially written frame or build unbounded resize backlog.

Required convergence regression:

```text
committed = 80×24
request A = 100×30 unresolved
desired changes back to 80×24
```

A restoring `80×24` request must be queued/coalesced in native event order, even though `80×24` still equals the last committed projection. Final convergence cannot depend on another native resize event when requests succeed.

### 12.3 `ResizeResult` handling

On `ResizeResult(request_id = R)`:

1. find exactly one unresolved record with ID `R`;
2. if none exists, treat it as `ResizeProtocolFailure`; never guess or mutate another request;
3. remove only record `R` after processing the result;
4. never clear, replace or suppress a different newer request because an older request failed;
5. `Applied` means Runtime completed PTY winsize and canonical resize commit for `R`, but it does **not** directly set `committedGeometry`; authoritative display projection remains the observation source for canonical rendered geometry;
6. a failure result is classified by section 12.6;
7. after processing, reconciliation may run, subject to retry suppression.

If an older request fails while a newer request is unresolved, the newer request remains valid. A bounded non-secret diagnostic may record the older failure, but it cannot trigger resend or invalidate the newer target.

If an authority/connection-class result shows the attachment is no longer allowed to mutate, that authority state applies globally even though request correlation remains exact.

### 12.4 Authoritative projection

When display projection reports geometry `G`:

- set `committedGeometry = G`;
- do not fabricate `ResizeResult` success locally; request records are retired only by actual results or connection teardown;
- clear stale visible resize-failure state if current desired geometry is now authoritatively committed and no relevant authority/protocol failure remains;
- rerun reconciliation, except retry suppression still blocks immediate resend of a failed same target.

This deliberately separates request outcome from display observation.

### 12.5 Runtime transaction and result ordering

Runtime applies each `ResizeRequest` exactly as:

```text
validate framing + unique request_id + Controller + AttachmentId + geometry
→ prepare all locally rejectable/infallible terminal resize inputs
→ apply fallible PTY winsize
→ if PTY succeeds, commit canonical TerminalState resize
→ canonical full damage
→ queue ResizeResult(Applied, request_id)
→ normal projection update
```

On semantic/operational failure after a trustworthy request ID is parsed:

```text
canonical state remains uncommitted for that failed transaction
→ queue exactly one ResizeResult(error_code, request_id)
```

The result is mandatory bounded control output and cannot be presentation-superseded. Runtime may continue terminal progress immediately; it never waits for the client to read the result.

If framing corruption prevents trustworthy request-ID extraction, use SPEC-004 Error/fatal cleanup. The client treats that as protocol failure and reconnect/recovery is explicit.

### 12.6 Runtime failure classes and retry gate

A failed `ResizeResult` is not itself a retry trigger.

**Authority / connection state:**

```text
InvalidState
InvalidExecution
InvalidAttachment
StaleIdentity
PermissionDenied
ControllerBusy
UnsupportedVersion
UnknownMessage
MalformedPayload
```

These disable resize mutation for the affected connection/attachment. Do not resend because of socket writability, queue capacity, projection updates or the result itself. Retry only after the corresponding connection/controller/reattach recovery or explicit recovery establishes usable authority.

**Request / operational failure:**

```text
CapacityExceeded
Backpressure
InvalidGeometry
DisplayUnavailable
InternalFailure
```

These surface non-secret `ResizeApplyFailure` state. If the failed request is the newest request for the current desired target and no newer unresolved request already targets that desired geometry, install retry suppression for that target.

The same failed target is not automatically resent because the request record was removed, projection changed, socket became writable, local queue capacity changed or Runtime produced more output.

A suppressed target may be retried only after one of:

1. a **new meaningful native-layout epoch** caused by viewport dimensions, insets or authoritative cell metrics changing and producing a fresh valid sample;
2. an explicit user/system “retry resize” recovery action;
3. reconnect/reattach or Controller-authority recovery when relevant to the failure class.

Each recovery event permits at most one new admission attempt for the currently desired target. Repeated Runtime failure reinstalls suppression. There is no timer-based retry, exponential loop, busy retry or result→reconcile→result recursion.

An unknown `ResizeResult.result_code`, duplicate result, unknown request ID, invalid reserved field or uncorrelatable type-18 protocol failure surfaces `ResizeProtocolFailure`, stops automatic resize submission and requires explicit reconnect/recovery.

### 12.7 Connection teardown

Disconnect/reattach invalidates every unresolved request ID and clears request/result transport state. Desired geometry may be recomputed/retained as native layout intent, but nothing from the old connection is treated as committed or retried until new attachment authority exists.

## 13. Exact AppKit `NSTextInputClient` composition seam

The permanent Metal terminal surface is first-responder capable and owns the native terminal focus target. No `NSTextView`, SwiftUI text editor or parallel terminal text surface is introduced.

### 13.1 Composition-only document

For text-input protocol purposes, M001 exposes exactly one bounded ephemeral `CompositionDocument`:

```text
text                 current marked/preedit text only
selection            selection/caret inside that text only
utf16Length          NSString/NSAttributedString UTF-16 code-unit length
maxUtf8Bytes         65,536
```

It never contains committed terminal input, visible terminal rows/cells, scrollback/history, shell prompt text, renderer cache text, semantic transcript/Blocks or clipboard contents.

All `NSRange` values in the `NSTextInputClient` seam are interpreted in UTF-16 code units relative to this ephemeral document, matching Foundation/AppKit string indexing. Range arithmetic is overflow checked before use.

Attributes from an incoming `NSAttributedString` are not retained in M001; only its `.string` content is kept. `validAttributesForMarkedText()` therefore returns `[]`.

The complete composition document must remain `<= 65,536` UTF-8 bytes. An update that would exceed the bound or contains invalid range arithmetic fails closed: do not mutate the prior document, surface non-secret `CompositionTooLarge`/invalid-composition state, then discard the input-method conversion session on a safe AppKit boundary without submitting marked text.

### 13.2 Required protocol methods

`hasMarkedText()`

- returns `true` iff the composition document UTF-16 length is greater than zero.

`markedRange()`

- with UTF-16 length `N > 0`, returns `{0, N}`;
- otherwise returns `{NSNotFound, 0}` exactly.

`selectedRange()`

- while marked text exists, returns the stored validated selection wholly inside `0...N`;
- with no marked text, returns `{0, 0}`, the only insertion point in the empty composition document;
- never reports a terminal/history range.

`setMarkedText(_:selectedRange:replacementRange:)`

- accepts only `NSString` or `NSAttributedString`; attributes are discarded;
- `replacementRange == {NSNotFound, 0}` means replace the current composition selection/insertion point;
- any explicit replacement range must lie wholly inside the current composition document;
- replacement and resulting selection use overflow-checked UTF-16 ranges;
- apply atomically only after resulting UTF-8 size and ranges validate;
- `selectedRange` is relative to the newly supplied marked string and is translated to the resulting absolute composition selection;
- never submits PTY bytes.

`attributedSubstring(forProposedRange:actualRange:)`

- operates only on the ephemeral composition document;
- if requested location lies completely outside the document, returns `nil` and sets `actualRange` to `{NSNotFound, 0}` when supplied;
- otherwise intersects with the document and adjusts to valid composed-character boundaries before returning a substring;
- `actualRange` reports the final UTF-16 range returned;
- terminal/history text is never consulted as fallback context.

`insertText(_:replacementRange:)`

- accepts only `NSString` or `NSAttributedString`, using only the plain string;
- an explicit replacement range is supported only when `NSNotFound` or wholly inside the ephemeral composition document;
- a range outside that document is `UnsupportedReplacementRange`; Seyal does not pretend terminal history is editable text storage;
- the supplied string is committed atomically through section 10.1;
- after the commit attempt, clear the composition document regardless of success/failure so rejected content is not retained for hidden replay;
- failed admission surfaces non-secret `InputAdmissionFailure` and is never automatically replayed.

`unmarkText()`

- is a **commit**, not cancellation, when marked text exists;
- snapshot the current marked plain string, atomically submit it through section 10.1 as one committed-text action, then clear the composition document regardless of admission result;
- if no marked text exists, it is a no-op;
- failed admission is visible/accessibility-safe and never automatically replayed.

`validAttributesForMarkedText()`

- returns `[]` in M001.

`firstRect(forCharacterRange:actualRange:)`

- never derives geometry by reading terminal/history text;
- validates/intersects the requested UTF-16 range only against the ephemeral composition document;
- returns the current disposable terminal-cursor/candidate anchor converted to **screen coordinates**;
- the M001 anchor is a zero-width caret rectangle with finite height derived from renderer cursor/cell presentation metrics;
- `actualRange`, when supplied, reports the validated/intersected composition range; `{0,0}` is valid for the empty document;
- if safe cursor/window conversion is unavailable, return a bounded zero-width fallback at the visible terminal surface rather than inventing terminal text geometry.

`characterIndex(for:)`

- M001 has no inline per-character preedit hit-test geometry, so returns `NSNotFound` for all screen points;
- never maps a point into terminal cells/history or exposes terminal text positions.

`doCommand(by:)`

- must not invoke arbitrary editing selectors against terminal/history state;
- participates only in disposition of the current AppKit input event. Input-system consumption is recorded locally; otherwise the native event router may classify the original event after the text-input context declines it;
- one physical event still follows exactly one route.

The optional `attributedString()` method is omitted in M001. If a later SDK/platform compatibility shim requires it, it may return only the ephemeral composition document and never terminal/history content.

Optional coordinate/text-access methods, if implemented, are composition-only. `windowLevel()` reports the owning `NSWindow` level; no method may synthesize a larger text document.

### 13.3 Cancellation and lifecycle are not `unmarkText`

True cancellation is separate from `unmarkText`.

On explicit IME cancellation, relevant focus loss, connection loss, controller loss, terminal teardown, or an over-limit/invalid composition failure:

1. tell the active `NSTextInputContext` to discard marked text/conversion when appropriate;
2. clear the local composition document;
3. submit **no** marked/preedit bytes to Runtime/PTY.

This preserves the distinction between AppKit commit (`insertText` or `unmarkText`) and cancellation (`discardMarkedText`/lifecycle cleanup).

While composition is active, IME-consumed Enter/Escape/arrows/control keys do not also escape through the semantic-key route.

M001 does not require rich inline preedit rendering inside terminal history. Candidate-window placement and composition state are presentation-only seams that can evolve later without replacing the terminal surface.

## 14. Minimum accessibility seam

Pass 7 keeps the Metal terminal surface in the native accessibility tree with:

- stable accessibility identity;
- terminal-surface label/description;
- focusability/focused-state reporting;
- geometry consistent with the visible terminal surface;
- non-secret exposure of input-admission/resize failure state without rejected input contents.

M001 does not claim a complete screen-reader text-range/transcript implementation. Later accessibility text exposure must derive from authorized terminal/history presentation state; it must not be sourced from the `CompositionDocument` or create a second VT/grid authority.

## 15. Latency instrumentation, budgets and privacy

Pass 7 measures:

1. native event receipt → client admission result;
2. client queue admission → successful socket-frame completion;
3. Runtime frame decode/admission → PTY write completion for accepted bytes;
4. native resize proposal → client admission;
5. Runtime ResizeRequest receipt → PTY winsize → canonical commit/result queue;
6. canonical resize commit → first display generation carrying new geometry, where measurable without adding a synchronous acknowledgement dependency.

Instrumentation records only monotonic duration, byte/count/geometry sizes, result category and aggregate counters/histograms. It never records text, encoded key bytes, marked text, terminal contents, environment values or secrets.

Request IDs are correctness metadata and must not be repurposed as telemetry or production trace IDs.

### 15.1 Pass 7 controlled-host performance gate

Before implementation begins, the implementation Issue records the exact controlled Apple-Silicon host/OS/build baseline from current `master` and freezes benchmark command/repetition/percentile method.

Targets:

- sparse native event receipt → client admission p99 **≤ 100 µs**;
- client admission → complete socket write when writable/uncontended p99 **≤ 250 µs**;
- Runtime frame decode/admission → PTY write when writable/uncontended p99 **≤ 250 µs**;
- controlled sparse native receipt → PTY write p99 **≤ 750 µs**;
- Runtime resize receipt → canonical commit at 120×40 p99 **≤ 1 ms**;
- Runtime resize receipt → canonical commit at practical M001 maximum p99 **≤ 2 ms**.

Pass 7 must also demonstrate:

- no persistent timer/poll loop for idle input/resize or retry;
- idle CPU within Pass 6 measurement noise;
- Pass 6 output/render p99 and active CPU no >10% regression under repeated controlled workload unless independently reviewed variance explains it and repeated median remains within 10%;
- steady-state client/Runtime RSS attributable to idle Pass 7 path grows by **≤ 2 MiB** total in the controlled single-surface workload;
- accepted client input/control memory never exceeds the 262,144-byte wire-byte bound plus fixed queue/container overhead;
- ResizeResult control traffic under live-resize remains bounded and does not create a material output/render regression.

A target miss blocks Pass 7 unless explicitly re-reviewed with measured evidence.

Every new/renamed production hot-path function participating in input ingress, queue admission, Runtime dispatch/encoding, PTY write service or resize commit must be registered in `scripts/check-hot-path.py`.

## 16. Required tests and validation

### 16.1 Native/AppKit deterministic tests

- first-responder acceptance/focus transitions and one-event/one-route classification;
- Command shortcut non-leak;
- committed ASCII/non-ASCII UTF-8;
- one committed callback → one atomic `Input` frame;
- >65,536-byte commit and queue-full commit reject atomically with visible non-secret state;
- dead-key composition commit;
- Return, Tab, Backspace, Escape, arrows and every Control ASCII mapping;
- Control-only, Control+Shift, Control+CapsLock and Shift-produced `@`, `^`, `_`, `?`;
- synthetic non-US-layout scalar-derived mapping;
- unsupported Command/Option/Function/NumericPad Control combinations;
- `CompositionDocument` only contains marked text and remains bounded;
- all composition ranges are UTF-16 and overflow checked;
- exact `hasMarkedText`, `markedRange`, `selectedRange` semantics;
- `setMarkedText` replacement/selection with `NSNotFound`, explicit in-range replacement, surrogate pairs and composed-character strings;
- out-of-document replacement never queries/replaces terminal/history text;
- `attributedSubstring` intersection and terminal/history non-exposure;
- `validAttributesForMarkedText == []`;
- `firstRect` finite screen-coordinate candidate geometry without terminal/history text;
- `characterIndex(for:) == NSNotFound`;
- `insertText` commits then clears composition on success/failure;
- `unmarkText` commits current marked text rather than discarding it;
- `discardMarkedText`/focus/controller/connection loss clears with zero PTY submission;
- over-limit/invalid composition fails closed and discards conversion;
- active-IME control/navigation keys are not duplicated into terminal input.

### 16.2 Protocol/Runtime tests

- capabilities bits 2 and 3 negotiate; older Pass 5/6 client tolerates both unknown bits;
- `TerminalKey` exact 24-byte round-trip and malformed/fuzz cases;
- `ResizeRequest` exact 32-byte layout; `ResizeResult` exact 32-byte layout;
- request ID nonzero/unique/monotonic/reconnect reset/wrap rejection;
- duplicate request ID rejection;
- Controller/Observer/stale attachment authorization;
- every structurally valid ResizeRequest receives exactly one matching ResizeResult;
- Applied only after PTY winsize + canonical commit;
- failed PTY winsize returns matching `InternalFailure` with canonical dimensions/generation unchanged;
- malformed/untrusted request-ID path never guesses correlation;
- older result cannot invalidate newer unresolved request;
- unknown/duplicate result ID fails closed in client state machine;
- accepted FIFO order across `Input`, `TerminalKey` and `ResizeRequest` barriers;
- queue limit/recovery and no unbounded allocation/busy retry.

The local binary-protocol fuzz target includes TerminalKey and correlated ResizeRequest/ResizeResult decode/state transitions.

### 16.3 Resize tests

- valid floor/clamp;
- NaN/+Infinity/-Infinity independently for every viewport/inset/cell operand;
- negative viewport/insets and non-positive cell metrics;
- derived non-finite arithmetic before floor/conversion;
- tiny positive → 1×1; huge finite → 512×256;
- desired==committed with no unresolved request → no request;
- committed 80×24, unresolved 100×30, desired returns 80×24 → restoring request retained/admitted without a new native event when requests succeed;
- failed **local admission** retries only after local capacity progress;
- persistent PTY winsize failure produces one result per permitted attempt and zero automatic retries from result/projection/socket/queue events;
- same failed target retries at most once after a permitted recovery epoch and repeated failure reinstalls suppression;
- older failed request does not clear/suppress newer unresolved request;
- authority-class failure stops mutation until authority recovery;
- unknown/duplicate/untrusted result surfaces protocol failure and never retries by guessing;
- disconnect clears unresolved IDs/state; reattach starts fresh ID space;
- backing-scale-only invalidation does not mutate terminal geometry;
- rapid live-resize coalesces only adjacent not-yet-started requests;
- input/resize/input ordering remains exact;
- partially written request immutable;
- resulting projection matches committed canonical state;
- repeated resize/show/hide/focus cycles leak no resources.

### 16.4 End-to-end acceptance

Using the real production path:

```text
native AppKit terminal surface
→ seyal-client
→ SPEC-004/006 local protocol
→ Runtime
→ TerminalExecution PTY
→ shell/application
→ Seyal VT/TerminalState
→ Candidate-D display
→ permanent Metal renderer
```

prove:

- focus/type a shell command, Backspace, Control-C and supported arrows;
- supported Shift-produced Control ASCII cases;
- real dead-key and at least one real IME path keep preedit local before commit;
- `unmarkText` commit differs from explicit discard/cancel;
- text-input substring/range queries cannot retrieve prompt/terminal/scrollback content;
- resize changes PTY/canonical/projection consistently;
- resize-away-then-return converges under overlapping unresolved requests;
- injected persistent winsize failure visibly reports and does not spin until permitted recovery;
- older failed request result cannot invalidate newer target;
- minimal alternate-screen fixture receives same input/resize path;
- output continues while another test client is input-backpressured;
- intentionally full client queue causes visible non-secret input rejection;
- observer cannot mutate execution.

### 16.5 Performance evidence

Benchmark sparse typing, key-repeat burst, legal 1/16/64 KiB commits, rejected >64 KiB commit, representative live-resize through M001 maximum, correlated result traffic, persistent-failure no-retry path, input under sustained output, alternate-screen input/resize and idle before/after.

Record exact SHA, hardware/OS/build, repetitions/percentile method, baseline/result, p50/p95/p99/max, CPU/RSS, queue depth/high-water, allocations/reallocations where instrumentable and socket/write counts. Never log input/composition content.

## 17. Failure behavior

- Runtime unavailable/disconnected: stop mutation acceptance, discard marked conversion without sending, preserve UI responsiveness and surface non-secret state.
- `ControllerBusy`: explicitly noninteractive; no preemption or silent typing loss.
- committed text >65,536 UTF-8 bytes: atomic complete rejection, no chunk/prefix, visible `CommitTooLarge`.
- client queue full: atomic rejection before ownership, visible `ClientBackpressure`, no main-thread block.
- rejected input never automatically replays.
- socket `WouldBlock`: retain accepted FIFO bytes and wait for writable readiness.
- PTY closed/finalized: reject input/resize and clean resources idempotently.
- local resize admission backpressure: retain desired geometry and retry on **local** capacity progress because no Runtime request was sent.
- failed ResizeResult: mutate only its exact request record; never invalidate a newer request; apply section 12.6 retry gate.
- persistent/unknown resize failure: visible non-secret state and wait for permitted meaningful layout/authority/explicit recovery, never internal retry loop.
- untrusted/unknown result correlation: stop automatic resize submission and require explicit recovery/reconnect.
- renderer failure does not change terminal authority.

## 18. Security and privacy

- no normal/error/performance log contains input payloads, semantic encoded bytes, marked text or terminal contents;
- protocol validation happens before unbounded allocation or mutation;
- only authenticated attached Controller submits `Input`, `TerminalKey` or `ResizeRequest`;
- stale AttachmentIds/request IDs never regain authority after reconnect;
- malformed/unsupported key events fail closed before PTY mutation;
- rejected committed text is not retained for hidden retry/telemetry/diagnostics;
- input/resize failure state carries only non-secret category/geometry/request-ID metadata;
- `NSTextInputClient` storage/query/range/coordinate methods operate only on bounded ephemeral composition state and never return terminal/history text;
- optional text-input methods cannot expose terminal transcript as a hidden document model;
- accessibility/IME helpers do not turn presentation text into authority.

## 19. Explicit non-goals

Pass 7 does not implement:

```text
Pass 8 Blocks / logical anchors / structured composer
Pass 9 full GUI close/crash/reopen proof
mouse reporting
clipboard / bracketed paste production semantics
Option-as-Alt / Meta configuration
full function/navigation-key matrix
application cursor/keypad modes
kitty keyboard protocol
full Unicode grapheme/emoji width
complete terminal screen-reader transcript API
full product-grade IME inline preedit UI
tabs / splits / workspaces chrome
agents / cloud / remote / mobile
commercial features
SwiftUI/NSTextView terminal rendering
```

## 20. Pass 7 definition of done

Pass 7 implementation is complete only when:

- real AppKit key event → Runtime → PTY → shell/application works on permanent Metal surface;
- committed text/semantic keys follow this spec;
- Control normalization is explicit/layout-aware/tested;
- committed callbacks are atomic and rejection is visible/accessibility-safe/non-secret;
- Runtime owns terminal-key encoding; client has no mirrored VT/mode authority;
- interactive surface owns Controller authority or is visibly noninteractive;
- queue is bounded/FIFO/readiness-driven with no main-thread busy wait;
- Pass 7 production resize uses capability-gated correlated `ResizeRequest`/`ResizeResult`, not legacy uncorrelated type 10;
- request results correlate exactly; older failures cannot invalidate newer requests; persistent failure cannot create automatic retry loops;
- resize transaction remains PTY winsize → canonical commit → result/projection with no synchronous acknowledgement dependency;
- geometry math is finite-safe and final desired geometry converges when not retry-suppressed by an actual failure;
- `NSTextInputClient` document is composition-only, bounded and UTF-16-range correct; terminal/history text is never returned;
- `insertText`/`unmarkText` commit semantics are distinct from cancellation/discard;
- deterministic/native/protocol/integration/failure/fuzz tests pass;
- exact-head latency/CPU/RSS evidence meets section 15 and no material Pass 6 regression exists;
- all new/renamed hot functions are in deterministic hot-path guardrail;
- OSS remains independent of commercial code;
- no Pass 8+ scope creep;
- independent final architecture/performance/security review has no unresolved blocker.
