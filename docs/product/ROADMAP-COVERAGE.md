# Seyal Roadmap Coverage Ledger

**Status:** Complete roadmap ownership ledger  
**Canonical source:** `docs/product/FEATURES.md`  
**Rule:** Every capability has exactly one current roadmap disposition. Capability names and product semantics remain canonical in `FEATURES.md`; this file assigns roadmap ownership by stable ID.

## Disposition vocabulary

- **Known future implementation** — accepted capability with one implementation package/epic.
- **Spike/R&D before implementation** — architecture/product uncertainty must be closed by the named spike before implementation.
- **Explicitly deferred** — intentionally outside the current committed exit gate.
- **Superseded** — legacy shape must not be implemented; the named owner carries the replacement need.
- **Rejected** — deliberately outside current Seyal direction.

The 216 historical `F-*` rows are fully accounted for: **137 known future implementation, 31 spike/R&D, 25 explicitly deferred, 15 superseded, 8 rejected**.

## F-* ownership

Ranges below are inclusive. Together they cover exactly the 216 IDs in the canonical RILL reconciliation table: F-001–029, F-030–047, F-050–089, F-090–104, F-110–124, F-130–164, F-170–180, F-190–205, F-210–231, F-240–250, plus F-252, F-253, F-254 and F-256. There are no duplicate owners.

## Existing backlog issue reconciliation

`#640`–`#650` remain discovery/reconciliation buckets, not a second implementation roadmap.

| Existing issue | Current role / roadmap home |
|---|---|
| #640 | Hierarchy/navigation catalog -> primarily M003 #674; agent/resource/deferred rows split by the F-* table above. |
| #641 | Persistence/recovery catalog -> primarily M004 #677/#687; agent continuity M005; live handoff M007. |
| #642 | Input/Blocks catalog -> primarily M003 #675; advanced composer/workflow work M006. |
| #643 | Terminal fidelity catalog -> M002 #672/#673/#684/#685; shell integration M003 #686; graphics M006 #689. |
| #644 | Attention catalog -> M005 #680; password notification remains explicitly deferred. |
| #645 | Agent catalog -> M005 #678–#681, M006 #682/#683, later cloud/collaboration rows M007/M008. |
| #646 | Remote catalog -> M007 #693 plus deferred transport/network options under #669. |
| #647 | Extra surfaces catalog -> M006 #683, mobile M007 #694, deferred utility surfaces under #668/#669. F-194 is superseded, not rejected. |
| #648 | Appearance/config/security catalog -> M003 #676, M004 #677/#688, plugins M006 #690, platforms M007. |
| #649 | Coding catalog -> M006 #683. F-240 bounded editor and F-241 optional/lazy LSP are accepted; F-250 DAP is rejected. |
| #650 | Product backlog umbrella -> roadmap governance/coverage only; implementation authority is the package named per capability. |
| #262 | Seyal-native umbrella -> all SY-001..SY-026 are individually mapped above. |

## #197 coding research children

| Child | Research capability | Milestone | Production home | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #201 | Palette file open | M006 | #683 | Bounded developer navigation. |
| #205 | Tabbed editor | M006 | #683 | Bounded editor; never terminal authority. |
| #209 | Editor R&D boundary | M006 | #683 | Research input before implementation. |
| #212 | Find/replace | M006 | #683 | F-242. |
| #216 | Syntax support | M006 | #683 | Editor presentation only. |
| #220 | Exact agent file/line | M006 | #683 | Uses stable resource/context identity. |
| #223 | Code review | M006 | #683 | F-243. |
| #228 | Code references | M006 | #683 | Typed references. |
| #231 | Code index | M005 | #681 | Context Engine prerequisite. |
| #236 | File tree | M006 | #683 | Root-bounded developer surface. |
| #239 | Agent changed files | M006 | #683 | Depends on M005 agent identity/context. |
| #243 | Diff -> build/test | M006 | #683 | Uses safe workflow execution #682. |
| #247 | Selected code context | M006 | #683 | Depends on #681. |
| #251 | Fix with agent | M006 | #683 | Uses M005 adapter/attention/context foundations. |
| #255 | Recurring defect memory | M006 | #683 | Retrieval/evaluation foundation from #681. |

## M001 specifications and accepted ADR implications

M001 is **Done / closed** and is not rewritten by this roadmap. Historical planning-baseline authority was #5 and `docs/milestones/MILESTONE-001.md`; Pass 6 implementation (#658 / PR #659) was unmerged at that planning baseline and later completed under the accepted M001 lineage.

| Authority | Roadmap enforcement |
|---|---|
| SPEC-001 M001 VT | M001 parser/state foundation; M002 extends breadth without replacing terminal authority. |
| SPEC-002 M001 PTY | PTY/child lifecycle stays at TerminalExecution; later panes/surfaces reuse it. |
| SPEC-003 M001 Runtime | Headless Runtime ownership remains beneath M003–M009. |
| SPEC-004 M001 Local Attachment Projection | Display client state remains derived/disposable for local and later remote clients. |
| SPEC-005 M001 Metal Renderer | Permanent macOS Metal renderer; no second GUI terminal state/renderer. |
| ADR-001 Local Display Projection | M003 UI, M004 restore and M007 thin clients project canonical Runtime state. |
| ADR-003 OSS/Commercial Repository Boundary | OSS never depends on proprietary code; M008/M009 private implementation consumes public seams one-way. |
| ADR-004 VT State Ownership | M002 Unicode/scrollback/compatibility modify one canonical TerminalState only. |
| ADR-005 PTY Execution Lifecycle | One PTY per terminal execution leaf; no popup/editor/agent shadow PTYs. |
| ADR-006 Runtime Reactor | Workspace/agent/persistence/cloud work never synchronously gates terminal progress. |
| ADR-007 Workspace Persistence & Agent Continuity | M004 recovery is honest about live-process limits; M005 continuity uses explicit durable identities. |
| ADR-008 Terminfo Capability Ownership | M002 advertises only behavior Seyal actually implements and proves. |

The accepted agent R&D program (#48, #51–#57 and `docs/architecture/agent-rd/*`) promotes to #678 (domain), #679 (adapter/presence), #681 (context/cache/evaluation/routing/privacy) and #682 (workflow/effect/replay/multi-agent). Security/performance isolation is a cross-cutting acceptance gate on #678–#683.

## Orphan audit rule

A roadmap audit fails if any new `F-*`, `SY-*`, #197 child, accepted ADR/spec requirement or newly accepted capability lacks exactly one disposition and one canonical owner/replacement decision here. Dependencies may be many; ownership must be one.
