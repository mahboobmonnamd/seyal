//! Runtime→client `ComposerStatus` publication (ADR-009 invariant 7; #978).
//!
//! The eligibility fact lives in the execution's integration state; this
//! module only projects it onto attached block-capable connections. A flip
//! is a 32-byte frame on the mandatory queue, like `ComposerResult`: a
//! submission's `Busy` must reach the client no later than the `Accepted`
//! result that clears its draft, and the next prompt's `Available` must not
//! wait behind a large display batch. The attach-time copy is queued after
//! display instead, because the attach handshake expects the first snapshot
//! right after `Attached`; if a flip overtakes it, the client's revision
//! fence drops the older copy. Per-connection queues never block PTY/VT or
//! projection progress.
